This is a port of Grapevine (written originally in VB6) to Rust.  It is
intended to be a library to access the binary database format and provide
operations.

Original Grapevine application:

	http://grapevinelarp.com/

Progress:

	We can read the header of the file.  We can't really read much else.
	The base struct is the GameData struct up to the menu file path.
