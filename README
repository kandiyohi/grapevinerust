This is a port of Grapevine (written originally in VB6) to Rust.  It is
intended to be a library to access the binary database format and provide
operations.

Original Grapevine application:

	http://grapevinelarp.com/

Progress:

	We can read the header of the file.  We can't really read much else.
	The base struct is the GameData struct up to the menu file path.

Some directions to go:

	We could look into providing just an API for anything you'd want to
	change in the database as is with the current UI.  After that, we could
	look into other file formats (xml, json), but keep compatibility (by
	way of conversions) with the database.
